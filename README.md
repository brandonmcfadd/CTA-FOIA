# The (incomplete) Public Archive of Chicago Transit Authority FOIA Requests

## Welcome
Welcome to a (very incomplete) public archive of FOIA requests submitted to the Chicago Transit Authority, compiled by Advocates, News Agencies or Citizens of Chicago.

## What isn't included?
There are a lot of reasons that a responsive request would not be included in this archive. Those may include but are not limited to: legal sensitivity, personal identifying information, and the right of the requester to review the materials first before distributing responsive documents en masse.

## File Organization
There are folders throughout this archive to assist in delineation of document contents to aide in gathering of similar data types. Many of the files have been renamed to provide clarity on their contents and therefore may not be the original names of the obtained files. More details of the file can typically be found in the commit details for that specific file upload.

## Questions
If there are any questions about the materials provided, please direct them to the repository owner, @nikhunder on Twitter or the original committer of the files into the archive.
